# Personal Blog Tutorial

This is a tutorial series based on Python and Flask. Here, I show how to start a Flask project until it is complete and hosted. Intentionally, I embark on showing how a building a personal blog can be a fun side project to learn Flask and web development in general. If you can build your own blog from scratch, why use a template?

The complete tutorial is found on my [Personal Blog Series](https://gitauharrison-blog.herokuapp.com/personal-blog).
