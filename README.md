# Personal Blog Tutorial

This project is used in my [Make A Personal Blog](https://gitauharrison-blog.herokuapp.com/personal-blog) tutorial series. Intentionally, I embark on showing how building a personal blog can be a fun side project to learn Flask and web development in general. If you can build your own blog from scratch, why use a template?

To run the application on your machine, clone this project:

```python
$ git clone git@github.com:GitauHarrison/personal-blog-tutorial-project.git
```
Create and activate your virtual environment:
```python
$ mkvirtualenv personal_blog # I am using a virtualenv wrapper
```

Install the dependancies used:
```python
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the application:
```python
$ flask run
```
